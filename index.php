<h1 style="color:blue">Pool Maintenance Services</h1 style="color:blue">
<h2 style="color:blue">Swimming Pool Maintenance Company Offering Custom &amp; Monthly Plans</h2 style="color:blue">
<p>
	Just like any other system in your home, your swimming pool requires regular
	 upkeep and maintenance services to keep it working properly. Specifically,
	 your pool has four main components that should always receive the proper
	 pool maintenance from a professional pool company.
	<strong>The four major areas of pool maintenance include:</strong>
</p>
<ul class="bullet-list v1 flex-wrap-spaced-between-block-800">
	<li>Pool water</li>
	<li>Pool surface</li>
	<li>Pool filtration system</li>
	<li>Skimmers and returns</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to our two decades of experience and training, we’re able to
	 design and implement the best maintenance plan for your swimming pool
	 that helps you keep your pool clean, safe, and healthy so you can enjoy
	 it whenever the opportunity strikes.</p>
<h2 style="color:blue">Why is Pool Maintenance Important?</h2 style="color:blue">
<p>Regular pool maintenance is the easiest way to make sure your pool is clean
	 and safe for anybody to enjoy. While it keeps things crystal clear, pool
	 maintenance can also save you time and money by preventing future damage
	 and extending the lifespan of your equipment.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Protects Equipment –</strong> Routine maintenance not only reduces the burden on your pool’s equipment,
		 but proper maintenance can extend its lifespan. This can save you major
		 money on future service calls.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Prevents Damage –</strong> While natural debris can seem non-threatening, ignored debris can help
		 algae begin to develop. Any cracks on your pool walls can be subject to
		 algae growth which in turn makes the crack wider allowing more water to
		 leak through. This can cause extensive damage to your pool’s substructure.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Keeps Water Clean –</strong> Your pool’s filter circulates the water and traps any smaller pieces
		 of debris to keep your pool’s water clean, while the chlorine levels
		 fight off bacteria. If your filter or pool chemicals are not maintained,
		 your pool will become an unsafe place to swim.
	</li>
</ul>



<h2 style="color:blue">What Happens When You Don't Keep Your Swimming Pool Properly Maintained?</h2 style="color:blue">
<p>If pool maintenance is ignored, your outdoor oasis can quickly turn into
	 a backyard disaster. Not only will you run the chance of causing major
	 damage to your pool’s plumbing and cleaning equipment, your pool
	 will begin to turn green which can pose major health hazards to not only
	 you and your family but your neighborhood and community as well.</p>
<p>Without the proper maintenance, dirty pools and other bodies of water can
	 harbor all types of recreational water illnesses and become breeding grounds
	 for pests like mosquitoes which spread other types of dangerous diseases.</p>
<p>Additionally, on things like ladders, steps, and general flooring, conditions
	 can become very slippery and unsafe due to algae growth.</p>
<h2 style="color:blue">Pool Maintenance Areas of Focus</h2 style="color:blue">
<p>If you want to make sure your swimming pool is in the best condition, proper
	 maintenance is an absolute must. To make things easier, America’s
	 Swimming Pool Company offers customized services designed to tackle a
	 variety of pool maintenance areas.</p>
<h3 style="color:blue">Pool Water Quality Monitoring</h3 style="color:blue">
<p>If your pool water is not monitored regularly and correctly, you may be
	 running the risk of bacteria and algae growth. To give you peace of mind
	 that your pool water quality is safe, we’ll provide weekly inspections
	 and progress reports letting you know the quality of your pool and the
	 progress of any treatments we’re working on. And if your pool ever
	 needs something to balance out the pH levels, we’ll take care of
	 it and let you know exactly what we did.</p>
<h3 style="color:blue">Pool Finish</h3 style="color:blue">
<p>Whether you decided on an aggregate, plaster, or tile finish, it must receive
	 the proper maintenance just like the rest of your pool. While proper brushing
	 of the pool’s floor, walls, and stairs a few times a month may seem
	 like enough, weekly skimming and scrubbing are necessary to keep things
	 looking like new.</p>
<p>
	The team will perform the pool finish services you need to extend the life
	 of your pool. This also includes routine chemical inspections and balancing
	 to prevent damage to your finish. Upon our inspection and
	 cleaning, we’ll let you know if we spot any signs of concerns such as loose
	 tiles, cracked plaster, or developing leaks. We’ll help with the
	 repair too.
</p>
<h3 style="color:blue">Pool Filter System</h3 style="color:blue">
<p>The filter system in your pool is crucial to your overall enjoyment of
	 your space. Without a properly working filter, your pool is subject to
	 algae growth, color change, pump clogging, as well as major damage to
	 the rest of your pool equipment.</p>
<p>
	Regular inspection and
	cleaning of your pool’s filter, as well as regular filter replacements, are some of the best things you
	 can do to protect your pool filter and extend its lifespan.
</p>
<h3 style="color:blue">Pool Skimmers and Returns</h3 style="color:blue">
<p>From insects and twigs to leaves and dirt, your pool is subject to just
	 about any type of debris that gets caught in the wind. When it comes to
	 keeping your pool clean, skimmers and returns can be your best friend!
	 Pool skimmers pull water through a filter for cleaning and then the returns
	 push the clean water back into your pool.</p>
<p>Not only do pool skimmers provide a way to continually circulate your pool’s
	 water, but they are also great at capturing debris before it sinks and
	 becomes harder to clean. Our team specializes in maintaining all makes
	 and models of pool skimmers and returns to make pool maintenance even easier.</p>
<h3 style="color:blue">Equipment and Inventory Management</h3 style="color:blue">
<p>Maintaining your swimming pool is much more than just checking the pool’s
	 chlorine levels and clearing away leaves. While they’re important
	 maintenance tasks, so is your pool’s equipment and inventory management.</p>
<p>Lucky for you, our team has the experience, knowledge, and organizational
	 skills needed to ensure your space is organized correctly and supplies
	 with everything you and our team need to keep your pool in check. Rest
	 assured, whether you’re low on a certain chemical or need a brush
	 replaced, we’ll handle it with ease.</p>
<h3 style="color:blue">Pool Inspections</h3 style="color:blue">
<p>Whether you’re in the process of buying a home or just inherited
	 a new space with a pool, it’s important to have it inspected by
	 a team of professionals. Since home inspectors are not always certified
	 in inspecting pools, turn ASP when you need quality pool inspections.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the things we inspect include:</strong></p>
<ul class="bullet-list v1 flex-wrap-spaced-between-block-800">
	<li>Tile</li>
	<li>Coping</li>
	<li>Decking</li>
	<li>Filter</li>
	<li>Heater</li>
	<li>Breakers</li>
	<li>Return lines</li>
	<li>Lights in the pool</li>
	<li>Diving board</li>
	<li>Water slide</li>
	<li>Fencing around pool</li>
</ul>
<p>When you request our pool inspection services, we’ll use our decades
	 of experience in pool maintenance and construction to deliver a thorough
	 report on the quality of the pool in question. From identifying how efficient
	 the pool is running to identifying any pool defects we found, you’ll
	 be able to make your next decision with confidence.</p>
<h2 style="color:blue">Green to Clean Services</h2 style="color:blue">
<p>Has your pool transformed into something more similar to a swamp? Whether
	 it’s green, black, yellow, brown, or even pink, your pool is likely
	 contaminated with algae and other bacteria and should be cleaned as soon
	 as possible.</p>
<p>
	Our Green to Clean service option is the best way to clean your green pool. This is a three to five
	 day process in which a certified pool technician will scoop and rid of
	 any debris in your pool, kill the algae and bacteria that have formed
	 by shocking the pool, and restore it to its former condition.
</p>
<h2 style="color:blue">Maintaining My Swimming Pool on My Own VS Professional Maintenance</h2 style="color:blue">
<p>If you’re looking for a way to maintain your home’s swimming
	 pool, you may be considering going the do-it-yourself route. While completing
	 it on your own is absolutely a possibility, it’s usually not recommended
	 due to how important pool maintenance is to the quality of your pool.
	 DIY maintenance may save you money upfront, but it tends to lead to a
	 pool that deals with more frequent issues, service calls, and pricey repairs
	 down the line.</p>
<p><strong>Some benefits of professional pool maintenance include:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Guaranteed Results –</strong> When you complete pool maintenance on your own, the results are your responsibility.
		 But when the services are provided and backed by a team of professionals,
		 you’ll have a guarantee that things will work out in your favor.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Save Time –</strong> Professional pool technicians deal with pools all day every day, so there’s
		 no question why they’re capable of performing any inspection and
		 maintenance services in a quarter of the time of the average pool owner.
		 Going professional can save you hours every week.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>No More Guesswork –</strong> Without doing the proper research, you can deal major irreversible damage
		 to your pool. For example, the wrong amount of chemicals can damage your
		 pool’s lining and even cause health hazards. Take the guesswork
		 out of pool chemicals by turning to the professionals!
	</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="color:blue">How Often Should I Have My Pool Maintained?</h2 style="color:blue">
<p>While the frequency of pool cleaning relies on a couple of key factors
	 like the size of your pool and how often it's used, our team recommends
	 having professional pool maintenance completely at a minimum once a week.
	 This helps keep the pool surfaces clean and the other uncontracted, free
	 of harmful bacteria and algae growth.</p>
<h2 style="color:blue">Pool Maintenance Costs</h2 style="color:blue">
<p>On average, professional pool maintenance will cost you anywhere from $120
	 to $300 a month. Of course, this price depends on a variety of factors
	 that are unique to your swimming pool and situation.</p>
<p><strong>Factors that can affect the cost of your monthly pool maintenance include:</strong></p>
<ul class="bullet-list v1 flex-wrap-spaced-between-block-800">
	<li>Size of your pool</li>
	<li>Frequency of maintenance</li>
	<li>Weather-related services</li>
	<li>Location of pool</li>
	<li>Type of pool (chlorine, saltwater, etc.)</li>
	<li>Number of tasks needed</li>
	<li>Repairs that are needed</li>
	<li>Amount of labor needed</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Your monthly pool maintenance cost will usually cover the full maintenance
	 of your pool including a focus on the water, pool surface, filtration
	 system, and any skimmers or returns you have installed. This is the best
	 way to keep every part of your pool, hot tub, and
	<a href="/services/hot-tub-spas/">spa</a> in the best condition possible for all the swimmers in your home.

<p>
	The key to keeping your pool crystal clear all summer long is
	<strong>remembering the three C’s of pool care:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Circulation –</strong> Water must be circulating via the pump, filtration system, skimmers, and
		 other water features constantly to ensure any debris is filtered out and
		 the water does not go stagnant.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Cleaning –</strong> Regular brushing of the walls, steps, ladders, and other low circulation
		 areas is a must, along with skimming off the top of the surface to collect
		 fallen foliage. Vacuuming is also important to collect any debris that
		 has sunk. Using an automatic cleaner makes this even easier.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Chemistry –</strong> Testing your water weekly is key to keeping the pH and chlorine levels
		 balanced. If things aren’t balanced, you may begin to develop algae
		 or subject yourself to dangerous chlorine levels. Depending on your situation,
		 a chlorine shock may be needed to sanitize and get the water back to normal levels.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Having our team develop and implement a customized swimming pool maintenance
	 plan can be the best way to ensure your pool is ready and able to be enjoyed
	 all season long!</p>
<h3 style="color:blue">How Often Should I Put Chlorine in The Pool?</h3 style="color:blue">
<p>
	Without knowing the specifics of your pool, it’s quite impossible
	 to give an exact answer of how often or how much chlorine you should be using.
	<strong>The ideal chlorine level for your pool should be between 1 and 1.5 ppm.</strong> If things aren’t at the right level, you may need a chlorine shock
	 or to add a chlorine neutralizing chemical to get things back to normal.
</p>
<p>After this, it’s important to keep your pool at optimal chlorine
	 levels via chlorine tablets. You can determine the exact amount and frequency
	 of chlorine needed by the volume of water, frequency of use, and the number
	 of hours the pool spends in direct sunlight. Our team can take care of
	 all of this for you!</p>
<h3 style="color:blue">Is It Better to Run a Pool Pump at Night or Day?</h3 style="color:blue">
<p>It is always best to run your pool pump during the day, specifically at
	 the hottest time of the day. This is because the sun eats away at your
	 chlorine, so running things during the day gives the chlorine a chance
	 to do its job instead of standing in a still pool being depleted by the
	 sun. If you have people in the pool during the day, running the pump can
	 suck up any foliage brought in and filter out sunscreen residue and other bacteria.</p>
<h3 style="color:blue">What Happens If You Don't Backwash Your Pool?</h3 style="color:blue">
<p>It’s important to backwash your pool about once a week unless otherwise
	 directed by a professional pool technician. A backwash plays an important
	 role in your pool’s cleanliness and sanitization by reversing the
	 flow of the filter and flushing out the water lines. If you ignore this
	 maintenance task, the flow of your system will go down, the pressure will
	 be reduced, and in some cases, the water filter can explode causing major
	 damage to your equipment and possible bodily harm.</p>
